1. Difference among getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector : when we need to work with only one unique element, getElementById is used for it. With getElementsByClassName we can handle multiple elements. When we need loop with multiple elemnts we have to use querySelector.
2. New element can be created with createElement and can be inserted with appendElement.
3. Event Bubbling : when an event triggers on child, it goes to parent.
